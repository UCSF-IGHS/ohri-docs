# Technical Implementation of RFE forms

RFE Forms is a lightweight form engine written in React and powered by Formik and Carbon UX. It uses FHIR along with OpenMRS' Web Services to communicate with the associated OpenMRS instance.

Technically, RFE Forms is a React component that requires the following properties(props):

## Mapping Controls

Fields are mapped to their controls via a registry system. This is highly extensible and easy to override the default controls.

```json copy
{
  "label":"Which of the following prevention services was the client referred to?",
  "type":"obs",
  "questionOptions":{
    "rendering":"checkbox",
    "concept":"5f394708-ca7d-4558-8d23-a73de181b02d",
    "answers": [...]
  },
  "id":"referredToPreventionServices"
}
```

The field above has the rendering of type checkbox, the engine will simply check the registry for this kind of control and instantiates an instance of this control.

## Submission Handlers

These handle submission at the field level. The engine doesn’t know how fields aggregate or compose primitive values into objects that the backend expects ie. an Observation. The form engine by default defines a set of base handlers eg. `ObsSubmissionHandler`, `EncounterLocationSubmissionHandler` etc.

These are also mapped using the registry system based on the `type` property of a form field. On form submission, the engine simply collects all field submissions and aggregates them into some object that OpenMRS understands.

## Extending the Registry

The engine exposes an API to work with the registry.

- `addHandler(handler: HandlerRegistryItem)` Adds submission handler to the handlers registry

  ```tsx
  import { SomeCustomHandler } from "./handlers";
  import { addHandler } from "openmrs-ohri-form-engine-lib";

  // Add to registry
  addHandler({
    id: "customHandler",
    component: SomeCustomHandler,
    type: "someCustomType",
  });
  ```

- `addvalidator(validator: ValidatorRegistryItem)`

  Adds validator to the validators registry

  ```tsx
  import { SomeCustomValidator } from "./validators";
  import { addvalidator } from "openmrs-ohri-form-engine-lib";

  // Add to registry
  addvalidator({
    id: "customValidator",
    component: SomeCustomValidator,
    type: "customValidatorType",
  });
  ```

- `addFieldComponent(control: ControlRegistryItem)`

  Adds custom control to the field controls registry

  ```tsx
  import { BootstrapDropdown } from "./controls";
  import { addFieldComponent } from "openmrs-ohri-form-engine-lib";

  // Add to registry
  addFieldComponent({
    id: "bootstrapDropdown",
    component: BootstrapDropdown,
    type: "bootstrapDropdownType",
  });
  ```

## Post Submission Actions

The form-engine supports post-submission actions. A post action is a JS class or function that implements this [interface](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-form-engine-lib/blob/881309c3a833001a8b561ade307b800b56184841/src/api/types.ts#L202.). This functional interface requires implementing the ``applyAction(formSession, config)`` function which has the form session context plus an adhoc config. The config makes the actions more generic and configurable hence the ability of reusing the same action for different use-cases.

### How do we register an action?
The engine utilises the ``registerPostSubmissionAction`` function to register a post submission action.

**Example:**

[HERE](https://github.com/UCSF-IGHS/openmrs-esm-ohri/blob/dev/packages/esm-ohri-pmtct-app/src/post-submission-actions/mother-child-linkage-action.ts) is an example of an action that links mother to infant post delivery and here is how it's registered.

```tsx copy

  registerPostSubmissionAction({
    name: 'MotherToChildLinkageSubmissionAction',
    load: () => import('./post-submission-actions/mother-child-linkage-action'),
  });
```

Take note that the registration happens in the app's index within the seeder func [startupApp](https://github.com/UCSF-IGHS/openmrs-esm-ohri/blob/f8b67904bdbb074787d00994a6a85b73f2a34531/packages/esm-ohri-pmtct-app/src/index.ts#L37).

After the action is defined and registered, we simply have to reference the action within the target forms.  This is the recommended and new way of doing things.
```json copy
"availableIntents":[
    {
      "intent":"*",
      "display":"Labour & Delivery Form"
    }
  ],
  "processor":"EncounterFormProcessor",
  "uuid":"1e5614d6-5306-11e6-beb8-9e71128cae77",
  "referencedForms":[],
  "encounterType":"6dc5308d-27c9-4d49-b16f-2c5e3c759757",
  "postSubmissionActions": [{"actionId": "MotherToChildLinkageSubmissionAction", "config": { "targetQueue": "Pre-Counselling", "isOptional": true }}],
  "allowUnspecifiedAll":true,
  "formOptions": {
    "usePreviousValueDisabled": "true"
  }
```
NOTE: We can also use the old way of linking post actions we didn't support configuring the actions then, see below. (The form engine still supports the old old way for linking actions)

```json copy
  "availableIntents": [
    {
      "intent": "*",
      "display": "Labour & Delivery Form"
    }
  ],
  "processor": "EncounterFormProcessor",
  "uuid": "1e5614d6-5306-11e6-beb8-9e71128cae77",
  "referencedForms": [],
  "encounterType": "6dc5308d-27c9-4d49-b16f-2c5e3c759757",
  "postSubmissionActions": [
    "MotherToChildLinkageSubmissionAction",
    "ArtSubmissionAction"
  ],
  "allowUnspecifiedAll": true,
  "formOptions": {
    "usePreviousValueDisabled": "true"
  }
```
