# Running the Form Engine against an OpenMRS 3.x frontend

Presently, [OpenMRS 3.x](https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs) (O3) ships the [OHRI form engine](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-form-engine-lib).

This version leverages [React](https://react.dev/) and [Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) to get its look and feel to match that of O3.

If you wish to modify the Form Engine and test it within O3 (or any other O3-based frontends), follow the steps outlined below:

## Prerequisites

You need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed on your system. You can check for whether yarn is installed by running:

```sh
  yarn -v
```

If this doesn't return a version number, you likely don't have it installed. To install it on your system, run:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Additionally, the [openmrs-esm-patient-chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) repository expects you to have `Node.js v16.x.x` or higher installed on your system.

## Steps

- Fork and clone the [OHRI forme ngine](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-form-engine-lib) repository.
- `cd` into your clone.
- `pwd` to get the path of the OHRI form engine , which you will use later. You should see something like
  ```
    /Users/johndoe/code/openmrs-form-engine-lib
  ```
- The engine is a library and not an O3 MF module. It can be consumed by bundling it within an ESM or custom frontend app that incorporates it within a UI workflow.

- You can make changes to the library and test them on forms in the O3 patient chart.

- Open your local `openmrs-esm-patient-chart` clone. Install dependencies using:

  ```sh
  yarn
  ```

- We'll then link the `openmrs-form-engine-lib` from the previous step inside of `packages/esm-form-engine-app`. To do so, run:

  ```sh
  cd packages/esm-form-engine-app
  yarn link ...

  # where ... is the path to your `openmrs-form-engine-lib` directory from the previous step. It could look like: /Users/johndoe/code/openmrs-form-engine-lib.
  ```

    If you're using Windows, you might need to wrap your path in double quotes.
  </Callout>

  It is very important that this step works correctly to establish the link between the formengine library and the frontend.

  Open the package.json file in the `esm-patient-chart-app` and confirm that in the resolutions section, you have something like
  ```
  "resolutions": {
    "@openmrs/openmrs-form-engine-lib": "portal:/Users/johndoe/code/openmrs-form-engine-lib"
  }
  ```

- Next, `cd` into the `openmrs-esm-patient-chart` root directory and spin up your local copy of the formengine by running:

  ```sh
     yarn start --sources packages/esm-form-engine-app  --port 8090 --importmap https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa/importmap.json
  ```

- Next, log into your 3.x frontend (could be `AMPATH 3.x`, `KenyaEMR 3.x`, or a community server like `dev3`) in your browser.

- Congratulations! You should now be running the local version of the formegine in your application.

- To test, search for a patient and open their chart. Find the forms widget and launch a clinical form in the workspace.

- Any changes made to the formengine app should propagate into the form displayed in the workspace.
