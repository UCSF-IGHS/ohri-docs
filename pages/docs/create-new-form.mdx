## Introduction

When creating user interface forms in OpenMRS frontends, the React Form Engine (RFE) form builder platform makes this task much easier by partially automating the process.

## What is the RFE form builder?

The RFE form builder found at the address: https://ohri-dev.globalhealthapp.net/openmrs/spa/login is an automation tool/website for auto-generating form schema JSON files which can be later loaded into the Form Engine to auto-create micro-frontend user interface forms.

This means the UI/UX developer does not have to manually create the user interface forms. And any technical/or non-technical person can use the form builder to generate these form JSON files.

### How to use the RFE Form Builder

Requirements:

- Make sure the Google Chrome browse is installed. Any other browser can also be used.

After the login form is loaded, enter all the required details in the inputs:

- **OpenMRS server URL**: This is the OpenMRS backend server installation where your concepts are stored.
- **Username**: Use the default i.e. `admin`
- **Password**: Use the default i.e. `Admin123`
