# Create a new form

## Introduction

When creating user interface forms in OpenMRS frontends, the React Form Engine (RFE) form builder platform makes this task much easier by partially automating the process.

## What is the RFE form builder?

The RFE form builder found at the address: https://ohri-dev.globalhealthapp.net/openmrs/spa/login is an automation tool/website for auto-generating form schema JSON files which can be later loaded into the Form Engine to auto-create micro-frontend user interface forms.

This means the UI/UX developer does not have to manually create the user interface forms. And any technical/or non-technical person can use the form builder to generate these form JSON files.

### How to use the RFE Form Builder

Requirements:

- Make sure the Google Chrome browse is installed. Any other browser can also be used.

In the address bar, enter the form builder URL: https://ohri-dev.globalhealthapp.net/openmrs/spa/login.

The main login form will open:

After the login form is loaded, enter all the required details in the inputs:

- **OpenMRS server URL**: This is the OpenMRS backend server installation where your concepts are stored.
- **Username**: Use the default i.e. `admin`
- **Password**: Use the default i.e. `Admin123`

With the correct details entered above, the platform will log you in. You will land on the dashboard illustrated below:

Now, click on `+Create New` in the top left corner to create a new Form schema.

A ‘hamburger’ reveals beside the ‘Form Builder’ link. Click on it to reveal more options.

Enter the form name

A Form can consist of Page(s), under a Page you can create Section(s), and under Section, you can create Form Questions.

**Note**: You can also create Section(s) directly under the Form without a Page.

To Create a Page, click on `+Create New Page`

![Create a new page](/create-new-page.png)

A modal opens, enter the name of the Page

Once created, click on the name of the page to expand and reveal more Sections.

![Expand sections](/expand-sections.png)

Enter the page label and select True under `isExpanded`

![Create section](/create-section.png)

Click on the name of the Section label drop-down to reveal the action to create a new Question

![Create new question](/create-new-question.png)

Create your questions, providing the relevant details appropriately.

Remember to always save as the form builder sometimes unexpectedly closes without saving your current work.

After you are done building all the forms, copy the generated json form schema to your project

Paste the json file to the packages folder under the relevant folder in the OHRI micro-frontend application project or OHRI’s UI editor.
