## What is the RFE form builder?

The RFE form builder is found at the following addresses: 

- OHRI: https://ohri-dev.globalhealthapp.net/openmrs/spa/form-builder
- Reference Application: https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa/form-builder

The RFE form builder is an automation tool/website for auto-generating form schema JSON files which can be later loaded into the Form Engine to auto-create micro-frontend user interface forms.

This means the UI/UX developer does not have to manually create the user interface forms. And any technical/or non-technical person can use the form builder to generate these form JSON files.

### How to use the RFE Form Builder

Requirements:

- Make sure the Google Chrome browse is installed. Any other browser can also be used.
