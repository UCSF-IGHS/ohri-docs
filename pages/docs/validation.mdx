# Field Validation

OHRI Forms is designed to support arbitrarily complex form field validations. Validation can be broken down into two types:

1. Date based validation
2. JavaScript expression based validation

## Date based validation

This type of validation enforces certain conditions for date inputs. You can use date-based validation to guarantee that a Date input only allows:

- Past or present dates
- Past, present or future dates

```json copy
{
  "label": "Date of Viral Load Result",
  "type": "obs",
  "questionOptions": {
    "rendering": "date",
    "concept": "163281AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
  },
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "date",
      "allowFutureDates": "false"
    }
  ],
  "id": "dateOfViralLoadResult"
}
```

The above question will not accept future dates, and this is the default behaviour of the date validator. You can override this behaviour and permit future dates by setting `allowFutureDates` to true in your validator definition:

```json copy
{
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "date",
      "allowFutureDates": "true"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation based on JavaScript expressions

When using expressions to validate form inputs, you must provide a JavaScript expression that resolves to a boolean value. Below is an expression-based example from a form used for collecting Cervical Cancer screening data:

```json copy
{
  "type": "obs",
  "label": "HIV Status",
  "isExpanded": "true",
  "questions": [
    {
      "label": "What is your current HIV status?",
      "id": "hivStatus",
      "type": "obs",
      "required": "true",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "9e4d6436-4040-46a3-a0ae-6dbc0acfe593",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV positive"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a896d2cc-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV negative"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a899b50a-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "Unknown"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validators": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Are you currently in HIV care or under ART?",
      "id": "currentlyOnArt",
      "type": "obs",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "a8afba58-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a899b42e-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "No"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validators": [
        {
          "type": "js_expression",
          "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && hivStatus == 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'",
          "message": "Please indicate whether the client is currently in HIV care or under ART"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  This question assumes that only HIV Positive clients are expected to be
  engaged in active HIV care.
</Callout>

A lot is going on in this example. Let us attempt to break it down step by step. The first question (id `hivStatus`) seeks to establish the client's HIV status. The next question (id `currentlyOnArt`) asks whether the client is actively receiving HIV care. Note that this second question has validation enabled.

```json copy
{
  // ...
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "js_expression",
      "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && hivStatus == 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'",
      "message": "Please indicate whether the client is currently in HIV care or under ART"
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
```

The expression evaluates two conditions:

1. That this question(id: `currentlyOnArt`) gets answered. `isEmpty(myValue)` returns `true` if this question does not get answered, and false otherwise.

2. That question with `hivStatus` has the answer with the value `a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838`. This value corresponds to the coded answer labelled `HIV Positive`.

The validation below restricts a user to only enter numbers only and while specifying the number of characters that can be entered. This works for fields like picking CCC numbers/Phone numbers.

```json copy
{
	"label": "CCC Number",
	"type": "obs",
	"id": "cccNumber",
	"questionOptions": {
	      "concept": "162053AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
				"rendering": "text",
				"maxLength": "10",
				"minLength": "10"
							},
							"validators": [
                    {
                      "type": "js_expression",
                      "failsWhenExpression": "!/^[0-9]*$/.test(myValue)",
                      "message": "CCC Number Should Be 10 Digits"
                    }
							  ]
}
```
The JavaScript expressions displays a fail message whenever a user tries to enter special characters or alphanumericals

## The above Validation enforces numbers by use of JavaScript expressions
