# Forms

A form is a collection of form fields classified through `pages` and `sections`. Forms are defined following a schema written in JSON. O3 forms are leveraging the [forms schema originally created by the AMPATH Form Engine](https://ampath-forms.vercel.app/core-concepts) with a few custom extensions. Below is a snippet of a basic form structure:

```json copy
{
  "name": "Hello world form",
  "pages": [],
  "uuid": "ff0933fb-20bd-4e44-a3e8-4073e9801ceb",
  "encounterType": "d105cbc3-728d-4d11-9ed3-637bf1a4e8a6",
  "availableIntents": []
}
```

Form schemas get constructed using the [AMPATH form builder](https://ampath-forms.vercel.app/getting-started#create-a-form).

## Form properties

The schema comprises of the following properties:

| Element            |                 Type                 |                                                    Description |
