# Forms

A form is a collection of form fields classified through `pages`, `sections` and `questions`. Forms are defined following a schema written in JSON.
React Form Engine (RFE) forms are leveraging the [JSON Schema](https://ohri-docs.globalhealthapp.net/docs/core-concepts/forms) with a few custom extensions. Below is a snippet of a basic form structure:

```json copy
{
  "name": "Hello world form",
  "pages": [],
  "uuid": "ff0933fb-20bd-4e44-a3e8-4073e9801ceb",
  "encounterType": "d105cbc3-728d-4d11-9ed3-637bf1a4e8a6",
  "availableIntents": []
}
```

Form schemas get constructed using the [Form builder](https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa/form-builder).

## Form properties

The schema comprises of the following properties:

| Element            |                 Type                 |                                                    Description |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `name`             |                string                |                                           The name of the form |
| `uuid`             |                string                |                                     The unique form identifier |
