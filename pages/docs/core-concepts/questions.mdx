# Questions

A question is the smallest unit of a form, and enables a single piece of data to be collected.

```json copy
{
  "label": "What is the reason for conducting the HIV test?",
  "type": "obs",
  "questionOptions": {
    "rendering": "select",
    "concept": "ce3816e7-082d-496b-890b-a2b169922c22",

## Question properties

Here's a reference of the various properties you can specify in a question definition:

- `label`: The actual content of the question. This label is what gets rendered as the question label. If no label is specified, the "display" value of the concept is used (which is generally the preferred name for the concept in the current locale)

- `type`: Provides information of how the submission value will be processed. It helps the engine map the target submission handler to a field. Currently supported types include: obs | obsGroup | encounterLocation

  - `obs`: questions of this `type` will yield an observation as a submit-able.

  - `obsGroup`: questions of this `type` will yield an obs group as a submit-able.

  - `encounterLocation`: questions of this `type` will capture a location that will be associated to the current encounter.

- `questionOptions`: An object defining other properties of a question:

  - `rendering`: The field type of the question. Currently supported types include: select | text | date | number | checkbox | radio | repeating | group | content-switcher | encounter-location | textarea | toggle | fixed-value read more about supported types.

  - `concept`: The concept UUID or concept reference mapping in the format "source:term" (for example "CIEL:1234") of the backing concept for this field.

  - `defaultValue`: The default value to be associated to this question.

  - `answers`: An array of answers scoped to a question. An answer definition consists of a concept UUID or mapping and label pair. If no label is specified, the "display" value of the concept is used. Below is an example of answers to a `Current HIV status` question:

- `questionInfo`: A property that recieves a string containing additional information regarding the field. When hovered over, it displays a tooltip containing the information passed.

  ```json copy
  {
    "questionInfo": "sample tooltip info for text"
  }
  ```

- `isHidden`: A boolean value that determines field visibility. In most cases, this value is driven by hide expressions.

- `hide`: You can use this to define logic for hiding a question based on certain conditions. To do so, you provide a JavaScript expression that evaluates to a boolean value:

  ```json copy
  {
    "hide": {
      "hideWhenExpression": "onArt!== 'a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
    }
    // This logic hides the question with the `onArt` id if the value of its
    // concept does not match the supplied value
  }
  ```

- `required`: If set `true`, that form field is considered to be mandatory. Defaults to false.

- `unspecified`: If set `true`, the form engine will render a widget(as part of this field) that can be used to mark this field as unspecified. By default, a mandatory field can't pass validation without a valid `value`. However, think of a scenario were it’s almost impossible to provide a value eg. when filling out a form in retrospective were a value wasn’t collected on the paper form. For such scenarios, a `required` field can be marked as `unspecified`.

  **What is the value of Unspecified?**

  Unspecified does not create an observation in the database. It is the
  equivalent of a NULL value in database systems (but does not create a NULL
  value). Unspecified is not a concept. It is rendered by the form engine and
  not persisted in the database.

      </Callout>

- `validators`: An `array` in which you provide validation logic for the specific question. Learn more about validators.
- `behaviours`: An `array` of supported behaviours. Learn more about form behaviours.
