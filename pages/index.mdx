React Forms Engine (RFE) Forms is a React component that renders forms based on the RFE Forms Builder. The RFE forms are well defined here. RFE Forms:

- Use the same schema as the AMPATH Forms Builder.
- May implement all features from the AMPATH Forms Builder.
- May define some extensions to the schema specific to OHRI to implement functionality needed by OHRI (such functionality may be suggested back to the AMPATH Forms Builder team for their consideration to include).
- Renders forms based on the Carbon Design system using React.
